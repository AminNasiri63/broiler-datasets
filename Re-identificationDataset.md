# Broiler Re-Identification Dataset
This dataset contains images of **787 individual broilers** captured from various forms and multiple viewing angles.  
All images were **manually cropped** to focus on the broilers, ensuring clear and consistent framing.  
The number of images per broiler varies, with a minimum of **9 images** and a maximum of **71 images** per individual.

The dataset was created to support research in:
* Broiler re-identification.
* Tracking tasks.
* Precision livestock monitoring.
