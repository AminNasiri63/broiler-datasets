# Broiler Datasets Repository
Welcome to the **Broiler Datasets Repository** ‚Äî a collection of curated datasets focused on broiler detection, broiler behavior, pose estimation, and re-identification.
These datasets were used to develop and evaluate deep learning models for precision livestock farming applications, including video classification and pose estimation. Our published research leverages these datasets to advance automated broiler behavior analysis.

The datasets were created to support research in:
* Automated detection and classification of broiler behaviors.
* Development of video recognition models for precise behavior quantification.
* Pose estimation and movement analysis of broilers for health monitoring.
* Broiler re-identification across multiple views for individual tracking.
* Improving deep learning techniques in precision livestock farming applications.
