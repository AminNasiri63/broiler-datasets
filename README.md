## Broiler Lameness Pose Estimation Dataset
Overview

This dataset contains a large-scale benchmark of 240 broilers with a total of 9,214 high-resolution images (1280×720, PNG format).
It is designed for broiler pose estimation and lameness detection tasks, and includes manually annotated anatomical key points and a defined pose skeleton.
All annotations are stored in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format.

The dataset was created to support research in:

    Animal welfare monitoring

    Computer vision–based lameness assessment

    Pose estimation and keypoint detection

    Biomechanical analysis in poultry
